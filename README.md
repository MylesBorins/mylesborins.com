# MylesBorins.com

src for my current personal website.  Was made with CabinJS while it was a thing. Now it isn't so I maintain a fork of the internal build stack [grunt-pages-redux](https://github.com/MylesBorins/grunt-pages-redux).

It's deployed using GitHub actions to GitHub Pages

## Getting Started

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

String theory was conceived and installed in the Fall of 2010.

The piece consists of a number of discrete components

* The String Sculpture: A static site based installation that utilized both hand / mechanical fabrication techniques
* The Bass Box: a hand constructed box that vibrates water through an internal subwoofer (credit to Sean Procyk for idea / implementation)
* The Big Box of Awesome: A hand constructed open ended control tool. The box allowed the audience to interact with the piece, changing the shape / colors that would be projected on the sculpture, and the sound that would be played through the bass box (via arduino + max/msp + dmx shield)
* Macbook Pro with Max/msp: Custom Patch to receive and transmit data via serial
* Laser: to make things extra pretty (Special thanks to Robin Glennie)

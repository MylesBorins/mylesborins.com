voxelMeter is an audio visualizer that uses the Fast Fourier Transform to visualize the frequency spectrum using cubes! It was built using cross platform open source software, and will compile/run on mac and linux... isn't that grand?

Find out more about the application on the [project site](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~mborins/256a/voxelMeter/)

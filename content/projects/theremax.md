A fully featured cross platform native application that lets you control sound and graphics with movement. All libraries used are cross platform including openGL, GLUT, openCV, and rt-audio. 

Theremax has only been tested on OSX 10.8 at the moment, but should be able to be compiled with a little bit of love on linux or windows. (I always take pull requests)

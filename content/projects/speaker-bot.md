<!-- The Autonomous Speaker-Bot was a physical embodiment of the tool-set that I developed during my undergraduate education. It included hand made physical hardware and custom code ranging from an extremely low level (such as user datagram packets), to extremely high level (such as pure-data patchâ€™s). -->

The Autonomous Speaker-Bot is a self-sufficient integrated media command centre that can be harnessed by users of various skill levels to create unique works of art. It is a computer, a web-server, a wireless hot-spot, an instrument, a learning tool, and of course a speaker. Externally, the Speaker-Bot appears to be an ordinary guitar cabinet, a well travelled wooden box covered in tolex that is used to house speakers. Embedded within the speaker is a gainclone hi-fi amplifier, a wireless router, two 12-inch classic fender speakers, and its brain, the Beagleboard. The Beagleboard is an ARM based embedded linux development board, a fully functional computer that is slightly larger than a deck of cards.
